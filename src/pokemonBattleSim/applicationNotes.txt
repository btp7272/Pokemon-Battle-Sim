Notes on Application

The application is set up such that App.java is the entry point.

From the entry point, all the needed models, views, and controllers
	will be instantiated.

All Models are stored in the models folder with the respective package.
All Views are stored in the views folder with the respective package.
All Controllers are stored in the controllers folder with the respective package.

These are the main components to the MVC pattern. 

However, not all files will be grouped into these folders.  

Common folders for these files are usually for strings (resources for different 
	languages), services (keyboard, OS connects, Internet connections), test data
	(for UI design) or folders with files that perform a specific job relative to
	the environment

At the time of writing, sample packages were created for this purpose.  While 
	most remain empty, they should be populated in the future
